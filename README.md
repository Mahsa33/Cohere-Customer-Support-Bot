# LLM For Customer Support Bot


This repository presents a sample customer support chatbot for Alibaba, developed using the langchain framework. The chatbot consists of two main files:

1. Cohere-based Chatbot:

This file demonstrates the implementation of a chatbot using the Cohere language model. Cohere is a powerful language model from OpenAI that can be used for various natural language processing tasks, including question answering, text summarization, and language translation.

In this file, the chatbot is used to answer common questions and requests from Alibaba customers. For example, the chatbot can provide information about flights, hotels, and other services offered by Alibaba.

2. Voice Chatbot:

This file includes the implementation of a chatbot that can take two text or image inputs and generate a speech output. 

The voice chatbot can be used to provide information to customers in an auditory format or to answer their questions in a more natural and engaging way.The chatbot can convert its responses into natural-sounding spoken language, enhancing accessibility for users who prefer audio information.
