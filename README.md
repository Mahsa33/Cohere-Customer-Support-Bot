Harness the power of natural language processing (NLP) to effectively handle customer queries, promptly resolve issues, and elevate overall customer satisfaction.

Note: The "KeyError: tool" error occurs due to the absence of the "bind_tools" tool in the Ollama model. To resolve this issue, the OllamaFunction class from the langchain_experimental library has been utilized. However, due to a bug in this library, the mentioned error may still occur.
